    "Apply to desired area. In case of sensitivity, dilute 1 drop with 1 drop of V-6â„¢ or olive oil. Add lemon to your skin care products to reduce the appearance of blemishes or to conditioner and DIY hair masques to give your hair a smoother, shinier look. Add a few drops to naturally derived floor, window, and surface cleaning solutions. Do not use Lemon oil on granite or stone, as it may etch the surface. Aromatic: Diffuse up to 1 hour 3 times daily. Diffuse Lemon alone or with other citrus and crisp-smelling oils such as Tangerine, Grapefruit, Orange, Bergamot, Rosemary, Tea Tree, and Eucalyptus Radiata to create an aromatic environment that is clean-smelling and positive. CAUTION: Keep out of reach of children. If you are pregnant, nursing, taking medication, or have a medical condition, consult a health professional prior to use. Avoid direct sunlight or UV rays for up to 12 hours after applying product.",
